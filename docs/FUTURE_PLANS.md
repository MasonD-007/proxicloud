- **Simplify infrastructure management** with intuitive UI/UX
- **Leverage familiar AWS patterns** (EC2, S3, IAM, etc.) on local hardware
- **Reduce complexity** of Proxmox while maintaining power-user capabilities
- **Enable Infrastructure-as-Code** for homelab environments
- **Provide enterprise-grade features** (monitoring, backups, security) at homelab scale

- Route table editor with visual connections
- Firewall rule builder with port/protocol selectors
- Export as YAML for IaC

#### Integration

**24. Prometheus/Grafana**
- Implement Prometheus exporter:
  - Endpoint: `/metrics` (Prometheus text format)
  - Export instance metrics, API request counts, error rates
- Create Grafana provisioning config:
  - Auto-provision ProxiCloud dashboard
  - Pre-built panels: CPU, memory, API latency
- Alert rules in Prometheus:
  - `instance_cpu_high` - CPU > 80% for 5 minutes
  - `instance_unreachable` - No metrics for 2 minutes

**25. Local Package Registry (Optional)**
- Deploy Docker Registry v2
- UI for browsing images: `/registry`
- Integration with instance creation (use private registry images)
- Garbage collection for unused images

**Deliverables:**
- Serverless function platform with HTTP/cron triggers
- Advanced networking with custom routes and NAT
- Secrets management service
- Interactive health map dashboard
- Prometheus/Grafana integration
- Network designer UI

## Technical Considerations

### Required Technologies

**Backend Stack:**
- **Language:** Go 1.21+
- **Web Framework:** Chi router or Gorilla Mux
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 14+ (production) or SQLite (development)
- **ORM:** GORM or sqlc for type-safe queries
- **Authentication:** JWT with `golang-jwt/jwt`
- **Testing:** Standard library `testing` + `testify` assertions

**Frontend Stack:**
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript 5+
- **UI Library:** React 18+
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS 3+
- **Components:** Shadcn/ui or Headless UI
- **Charts:** Chart.js or Recharts
- **State Management:** React Context or Zustand

**Infrastructure:**
- **Proxmox:** VE 8.0+
- **Storage:** ZFS on Proxmox host
- **Networking:** Linux bridges, VLANs
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana (Phase 3)
- **Container Runtime:** LXC (for instances and functions)

**Development Tools:**
- **Version Control:** Git
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (build, test, lint)
- **Database Migrations:** golang-migrate
- **API Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Linting:** golangci-lint, ESLint

---

### Architecture Decisions

**1. Single-Node Design**
- ProxiCloud is designed for single Proxmox nodes
- No distributed consensus (no etcd, Consul, etc.)
- Simplifies deployment and reduces complexity
- Trade-off: No high availability or automatic failover

**2. Database Choice**
- PostgreSQL for production (robust, feature-rich)
- SQLite for development/testing (zero-config)
- Schema designed to support both via GORM

**3. API Design Philosophy**
- RESTful conventions (resources, HTTP verbs)
- Consistent error responses (JSON with error codes)
- Pagination for list endpoints (limit, offset)
- Filtering via query parameters

**4. Security Model**
- JWT tokens with short expiry (24hr)
- Bcrypt for password hashing (cost factor 12)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Per-user resource isolation at database level
- Audit logging for compliance

**5. Storage Strategy**
- ZFS for all storage (instances, volumes, backups)
- Leverage ZFS features: snapshots, compression, dedup
- Object storage uses filesystem (ZFS datasets)
- No external storage systems (Ceph, GlusterFS)

### Key Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Proxmox API Limitations**
- Some features may require shell access (not available via API)
- **Mitigation:** Use SSH connection for complex operations; wrap in Go functions

**Risk 2: Single-Node Constraints**
- No true HA or multi-AZ support
- **Mitigation:** Focus on backup/restore; clear documentation of limitations

**Risk 3: Performance with Large Files**
- S3-lite uploads may be slow for files >1GB
- **Mitigation:** Implement multipart uploads; use chunked transfer encoding

**Risk 4: Security of Serverless Functions**
- User code execution is inherently risky
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Run in unprivileged LXC containers
  - Apply strict resource limits (CPU, memory, timeout)
  - Network isolation (no internet access by default)
  - Audit all function code uploads

**Risk 5: Database Growth**
- Metrics and logs can grow indefinitely
- **Mitigation:** Implement retention policies; use partitioning; archive old data

**Risk 6: Proxmox Version Compatibility**
- API changes between Proxmox versions
- **Mitigation:** Document supported versions; version detection in code

---

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**
- All Go handlers and services
- Target: 80%+ code coverage
- Mock Proxmox API client for tests
- Use table-driven tests for edge cases

**Integration Tests**
- Test API endpoints against real database
- Use testcontainers for PostgreSQL
- Verify request/response cycles
- Test authentication flows

**E2E Tests**
- Critical user workflows:
  1. Launch instance → attach volume → start instance
  2. Create bucket → upload object → download object
  3. Create user → login → view resources (isolation)
- Use Playwright or Cypress for frontend
- Run against staging environment

**Load Tests**
- Simulate multiple concurrent users
- Test API rate limits
- Identify bottlenecks (database queries, Proxmox API calls)
- Tools: k6 or Apache Bench

**Security Tests**
- Penetration testing for auth bypass
- SQL injection attempts
- CSRF protection verification
- Secrets leakage in logs/errors

---

### Performance Targets

**API Response Times:**
- List endpoints: < 200ms (p95)
- Create/update operations: < 1s (p95)
- Delete operations: < 500ms (p95)
- Metrics queries: < 300ms (p95)

**UI Responsiveness:**
- Time to Interactive (TTI): < 2s
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1s
- Page transitions: < 100ms

**Throughput:**
- API: 1000 req/sec (single instance)
- Object storage uploads: 100 MB/s (limited by disk)
- Concurrent VM launches: 10 (limited by Proxmox)

**Resource Utilization:**
- Backend: < 512MB RAM, < 5% CPU (idle)
- Frontend: < 100MB RAM, < 2% CPU (idle)
- Database: < 1GB storage for 100 instances
